XML package v0.5.1

This is the third test release of the Python XML package.  The
distribution contains a validating XML parser, an implementation of
the SAX and DOM programming interfaces, an interface to the Expat
parser (and the Expat parser itself), and a C helper module that can
speed up xmllib.py by a factor of 5.  There's even documentation!

For information on the licensing conditions for each component,
consult the LICENCE file.

The only requirements for installing the package is Python 1.5 or
later, and a C compiler.

To compile everything, simply perform the following steps.

1) 
 Run "make -f Makefile.pre.in boot".  This creates Makefile
 (producing Makefile.pre and sedscript as intermediate files) and
 config.c, incorporating the values for sys.prefix, sys.exec_prefix
 and sys.version from the installed Python binary.  For this to work,
 the python binary must be on your path.  If this fails, try

   make -f Makefile.pre.in Makefile VERSION=1.5 installdir=<prefix>

 where <prefix> is the prefix used to install Python for installdir
 (and possibly similar for exec_installdir=<exec_prefix>).

2) 
 Once the Makefile has been constructed, run "make" to compile the C modules.
 There's no test suite yet, but there will be one someday.

3)
 To install everything in the site-packages directory as an xml/ package, 
 run "make install".

If you have difficulty installing this software, send a problem report
to <xml-sig@python.org> describing the problem.
