XML package v0.8

This is the Python XML package.  The distribution contains a
validating XML parser, an implementation of the SAX and DOM
programming interfaces, an interface to the Expat parser (and the
Expat parser itself), and a C helper module that can speed up
xmllib.py by a factor of 5.  There's even documentation!

For information on the licensing conditions for each component,
consult the LICENCE file.

The only requirements for installing the package are Python 2.0 or
later, and a C compiler. Note that the Python must actually be an
INSTALLed python, rather than one that is being used directly from
Python's build area. This release has been tested with Python 2.x.

To compile everything, simply perform the following steps.

1) Run "python setup.py build" to copy *.py files and compile the C
   extensions.

2) To install everything in the site-packages directory as an xml/
   package, run "python setup.py install".

If you intend to install FourThought's 4Suite package, there may be a
conflict between the packages xml.xpath and xml.xslt provided here,
and those provided by 4Suite. In this case, it is advisable not to
install XPath and XSLT support from this package. To do so, pass the
options --without-xpath and --without-xslt to setup.py: "python
setup.py --without-xpath --without-xslt install".

If you use a binary distribution package, no compiler is needed, and
setup.py does not need to be run.

If you have difficulty installing this software, send a problem report
to <xml-sig@python.org> describing the problem.
