XXX what's the license for everything?  Python-style?

This is the second test release of the Python XML package.  The
distribution contains a validating XML parser, an implementation
of the SAX programming interface, along with a Python interface to the
Expat parser, and a C helper module that can speed up xmllib.py by a
factor of 5.  There's even documentation!

	There's also a very new DOM implementation included here, that
tries to comply with the DOM Recommendation, and almost manages it;
there are still some deviations from the specification that need to be
fixed.  The DOM is relatively new, and will benefit from being tested
in this release.

To compile everything, simply perform the following steps.

1) 
 Run "make -f Makefile.pre.in boot".  This creates Makefile
 (producing Makefile.pre and sedscript as intermediate files) and
 config.c, incorporating the values for sys.prefix, sys.exec_prefix
 and sys.version from the installed Python binary.  For this to work,
 the python binary must be on your path.  If this fails, try

   make -f Makefile.pre.in Makefile VERSION=1.5 installdir=<prefix>

 where <prefix> is the prefix used to install Python for installdir
 (and possibly similar for exec_installdir=<exec_prefix>).

2) 
 Once the Makefile has been constructed, run "make" to compile the C modules.
 There's no test suite yet, but there will be one someday.

3)
 To install everything in the site-packages directory as an xml/ package, 
 run "make install".
