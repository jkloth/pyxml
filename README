XML package v0.6.0

This is the Python XML package.  The distribution contains a
validating XML parser, an implementation of the SAX and DOM
programming interfaces, an interface to the Expat parser (and the
Expat parser itself), and a C helper module that can speed up
xmllib.py by a factor of 5.  There's even documentation!

For information on the licensing conditions for each component,
consult the LICENCE file.

The only requirements for installing the package are Python 1.6 or
later, and a C compiler (unless the pyexpat module is already part of
your Python installation). This release has been tested only with
Python 2.0b1; it won't work with Python 1.5 - use older releases of
this package if you have only Python 1.5.

To compile everything, simply perform the following steps.

1) 
 Run "python setup.py build" to copy *.py files and compile the C extensions.

2)
 To install everything in the site-packages directory as an xml/ package, 
 run "python setup.py install".

If you have difficulty installing this software, send a problem report
to <xml-sig@python.org> describing the problem.
