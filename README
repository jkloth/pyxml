XML package v0.5.6

This is the Python XML package.  The distribution contains a
validating XML parser, an implementation of the SAX and DOM
programming interfaces, an interface to the Expat parser (and the
Expat parser itself), and a C helper module that can speed up
xmllib.py by a factor of 5.  There's even documentation!

For information on the licensing conditions for each component,
consult the LICENCE file.

The only requirements for installing the package are Python 1.5 or
later, and a C compiler.  It's recommended that you have the Distutils
installed; fetch the latest version from
http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/.

To compile everything, simply perform the following steps.

1) 
 Run "python setup.py build" to copy *.py files and compile the C extensions.

2)
 To install everything in the site-packages directory as an xml/ package, 
 run "python setup.py install".

If you have difficulty installing this software, send a problem report
to <xml-sig@python.org> describing the problem.
