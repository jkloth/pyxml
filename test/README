This directory contains unit tests for the PyXML package.

To run the tests under CPython, you need to either install PyXML first
or add the appropriate build directory (created by distutils) to your
PYTHONPATH environment variable. (This will be
build/lib.<platform>-<version>, relative to the top level of the PyXML
source distribution.)  Run the testxml.py script to execute the tests.

Two additional scripts are provided to run a larger set of tests for
the DOM implementations available in PyXML.  These tests are based
only on the W3C specifications and the Python bindings.  The script
chkdom_4dom.py runs the tests on the 4DOM implementation (the primary
DOM implementation included with PyXML), and chkdom_minidom.py runs
the same tests on the minidom implementation (shared with the Python
standard library).  These tests are incredibly detailed, and no known
Python DOM passes the entire suite.
