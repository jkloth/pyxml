This is a snapshot release of my current implementation of DOM (core, level 1).

In fact there are many differences from the specs, for points where I
thought that a ``pythonic'' interface was better than a ``corbaic'' one.

Included files are:

dom/core.py : Python implementation of the Document Object Model, Level 1.

dom/builder.py : root class for event-driven DOM builders.

dom/esis_builder.py : DOM builder from ESIS output.

dom/html_builder.py : DOM builder built on sgmllib.py.  Incorrect HTML
may produce strange results.  

dom/sax_builder.py : DOM builder as a SAX event handler.

dom/transformer.py : prototypical tranformation engine.

dom/utils.py : Various commonly-used utility functions and classes.

dom/walker.py : Class for traversing a DOM tree.

dom/writer.py : XML / HTML lineariser / writer.

README : this file.
