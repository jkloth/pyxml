  Abstract:
  
   XML is the eXtensible Markup Language, a subset of SGML, intended to
   allow the creation and processing of application-specific markup
   languages. Python makes an excellent language for processing XML data.
   This document is the reference manual for the Python/XML package,
   containing several XML modules.
   
   This is a draft document; 'XXX' in the text indicates that something
   has to be filled in later, or rewritten, or verified, or something.

                             1. xml.parsers.xmllib
                                       
   This is a version of the xmllib module from Python 1.5, modified to
   use the sgmlop C extension when it's available. This produces a
   significant speedup, amounting to about a factor of 5. The interface
   is unchanged from the original xmllib module; consult the Python
   Library Reference documentation for that module.
   
                              2. xml.sax.saxexts
                                       
   make_parser ([parser])
          A utility function that returns a Parser object for a
          non-validating XML parser. If parser is specified, it must be a
          parser name; otherwise, a list of available parsers is checked
          and the fastest one chosen.
          
   HTMLParserFactory
          An instance of the ParserFactory class that's already been
          prepared with a list of HTML parsers. Simply call its
          make_parser() method to get a Parser object.
          
   SGMLParserFactory
          An instance of the ParserFactory class that's already been
          prepared with a list of SGML parsers. Simply call its
          make_parser() method to get a parser object.
          
   XMLParserFactory
          An instance of the ParserFactory class that's already been
          prepared with a list of nonvalidating XML parsers. Simply call
          its make_parser() method to get a parser object.
          
   XMLValParserFactory
          An instance of the ParserFactory class that's already been
          prepared with a list of validating XML parsers. Simply call its
          make_parser() method to get a parser object.
          
   ExtendedParser ()
          This class is an experimental extended parser interface, that
          offers additional functionality that may be useful. However,
          it's not specified by the SAX specification.
          
2.1 ExtendedParser methods

   close ()
          Called after the last call to feed, when there are no more
          data.
          
   feed (data)
          Feeds data to the parser.
          
   get_parser_name ()
          Returns a single-word parser name.
          
   get_parser_version ()
          Returns the version of the imported parser, which may not be
          the one the driver was implemented for.
          
   is_dtd_reading ()
          True if the parser is non-validating, but conforms to the XML
          specification by reading the DTD.
          
   is_validating ()
          Returns true if the parser is validating, false otherwise.
          
   reset ()
          Makes the parser start parsing afresh.
          
   ParserFactory ()
          A general class to be used by applications for creating parsers
          on foreign systems where it is unknown which parsers exist.
          
2.2 ParserFactory methods

   get_parser_list ()
          Returns the list of possible drivers. Currently this starts out
          as ["xml.sax.drivers.drv_xmltok",
          "xml.sax.drivers.drv_xmlproc",
          "xml.sax.drivers.drv_xmltoolkit",
          "xml.sax.drivers.drv_xmllib"].
          
   make_parser ([driver_name])
          Returns a SAX driver for the first available parser of the
          parsers in the list. Note that the list contains drivers, so it
          first tries the driver and if that exists imports it to see if
          the parser also exists. If no parsers are available a
          SAXException is thrown.
          
          Optionally, driver_name can be a string containing the name of
          the driver to be used; the stored parser list will then not be
          used at all.
          
   set_parser_list (list)
          Sets the driver list to list.
          
                               3. xml.sax.saxlib
                                       
   AttributeList ()
          Interface for an attribute list. This interface provides
          information about a list of attributes for an element (only
          specified or defaulted attributes will be reported). Note that
          the information returned by this object will be valid only
          during the scope of the DocumentHandler.startElement callback,
          and the attributes will not necessarily be provided in the
          order declared or specified.
          
   DocumentHandler ()
          Handle general document events. This is the main client
          interface for SAX: it contains callbacks for the most important
          document events, such as the start and end of elements. You
          need to create an object that implements this interface, and
          then register it with the Parser. If you do not want to
          implement the entire interface, you can derive a class from
          HandlerBase, which implements the default functionality. You
          can find the location of any document event using the Locator
          interface supplied by setDocumentLocator().
          
   DTDHandler ()
          Handle DTD events. This interface specifies only those DTD
          events required for basic parsing (unparsed entities and
          attributes). If you do not want to implement the entire
          interface, you can extend HandlerBase, which implements the
          default behaviour.
          
   EntityResolver ()
          This is the basic interface for resolving entities. If you
          create an object implementing this interface, then register the
          object with your Parser instance, the parser will call the
          method in your object to resolve all external entities. Note
          that HandlerBase implements this interface with the default
          behaviour.
          
   ErrorHandler ()
          This is the basic interface for SAX error handlers. If you
          create an object that implements this interface, then register
          the object with your Parser, the parser will call the methods
          in your object to report all warnings and errors. There are
          three levels of errors available: warnings, (possibly)
          recoverable errors, and unrecoverable errors. All methods take
          a SAXParseException as the only parameter.
          
   HandlerBase ()
          Default base class for handlers. This class implements the
          default behaviour for four SAX interfaces, inheriting from them
          all : EntityResolver, DTDHandler, DocumentHandler, and
          ErrorHandler. Rather than implementing those full interfaces,
          you may simply extend this class and override the methods that
          you need. Note that the use of this class is optional, since
          you are free to implement the interfaces directly if you wish.
          
   Locator ()
          Interface for associating a SAX event with a document location.
          A locator object will return valid results only during calls to
          SAXDocumentHandler methods; at any other time, the results are
          unpredictable.
          
   Parser ()
          Basic interface for SAX (Simple API for XML) parsers. All SAX
          parsers must implement this basic interface: it allows users to
          register handlers for different types of events and to initiate
          a parse from a URI, a character stream, or a byte stream. SAX
          parsers should also implement a zero-argument constructor.
          
   SAXException (msg, exception, locator)
          Encapsulate an XML error or warning. This class can contain
          basic error or warning information from either the XML parser
          or the application: you can subclass it to provide additional
          functionality, or to add localization. Note that although you
          will receive a SAXException as the argument to the handlers in
          the ErrorHandler interface, you are not actually required to
          throw the exception; instead, you can simply read the
          information in it.
          
   SAXParseException (msg, exception, locator)
          Encapsulate an XML parse error or warning. This exception will
          include information for locating the error in the original XML
          document. Note that although the application will receive a
          SAXParseException as the argument to the handlers in the
          ErrorHandler interface, the application is not actually
          required to throw the exception; instead, it can simply read
          the information in it and take a different action.
          
          Since this exception is a subclass of SAXException, it inherits
          the ability to wrap another exception.
          
3.1 AttributeList methods

   getLength ()
          Return the number of attributes in the list.
          
   getName (i)
          Return the name of attribute i in the list.
          
   getType (i)
          Return the type of an attribute in the list. i can be either
          the integer index or the attribute name.
          
   getValue (i)
          Return the value of an attribute in the list. i can be either
          the integer index or the attribute name.
          
3.2 DocumentHandler methods

   characters (ch, start, length)
          Handle a character data event.
          
   endDocument ()
          Handle an event for the end of a document.
          
   endElement (name)
          Handle an event for the end of an element.
          
   ignorableWhitespace (ch, start, length)
          Handle an event for ignorable whitespace in element content.
          
   processingInstruction (target, data)
          Handle a processing instruction event.
          
   setDocumentLocator (locator)
          Receive an object for locating the origin of SAX document
          events. You'll probably want to store the value of locator as
          an attribute of the handler instance.
          
   startDocument ()
          Handle an event for the beginning of a document.
          
   startElement (name, attrs)
          Handle an event for the beginning of an element.
          
3.3 DTDHandler methods

   notationDecl (name, publicId, systemId)
          Handle a notation declaration event.
          
   unparsedEntityDecl (publicId, systemId, notationName)
          Handle an unparsed entity declaration event.
          
3.4 EntityResolver methods

   resolveEntity (name, publicId, systemId)
          Resolve the system identifier of an entity.
          
3.5 ErrorHandler methods

   error (exception)
          Handle a recoverable error.
          
   fatalError (exception)
          Handle a non-recoverable error.
          
   warning (exception)
          Handle a warning.
          
3.6 Locator methods

   getColumnNumber ()
          Return the column number where the current event ends.
          
   getLineNumber ()
          Return the line number where the current event ends.
          
   getPublicId ()
          Return the public identifier for the current event.
          
   getSystemId ()
          Return the system identifier for the current event.
          
3.7 Parser methods

   parse (systemId)
          Parse an XML document from a system identifier.
          
   parseFile (fileobj)
          Parse an XML document from a file-like object.
          
   setDocumentHandler (handler)
          Register an object to receive basic document-related events.
          
   setDTDHandler (handler)
          Register an object to receive basic DTD-related events.
          
   setEntityResolver (resolver)
          Register an object to resolve external entities.
          
   setErrorHandler (handler)
          Register an object to receive error-message events.
          
   setLocale (locale)
          Allow an application to set the locale for errors and warnings.
          SAX parsers are not required to provide localisation for errors
          and warnings; if they cannot support the requested locale,
          however, they must throw a SAX exception. Applications may
          request a locale change in the middle of a parse.
          
3.8 SAXException methods

   getException ()
          Return the embedded exception, if any.
          
   getMessage ()
          Return a message for this exception.
          
3.9 SAXParseException methods

   getColumnNumber ()
          Return the column number of the end of the text where the
          exception occurred.
          
   getLineNumber ()
          Return the line number of the end of the text where the
          exception occurred.
          
   getPublicId ()
          Return the public identifier of the entity where the exception
          occurred.
          
   getSystemId ()
          Return the system identifier of the entity where the exception
          occurred.
          
                              4. xml.sax.saxutils
                                       
   Canonizer (writer)
          A SAX document handler that produces canonicalized XML output.
          writer must support a write() method which accepts a single
          string.
          
   ErrorPrinter ()
          A simple class that just prints error messages to standard
          error (sys.stderr).
          
   ESISDocHandler (writer)
          A SAX document handler that produces naive ESIS output. writer
          must support a write() method which accepts a single string.
          
   EventBroadcaster (list)
          Takes a list of objects and forwards any method calls received
          to all objects in the list. The attribute list holds the list
          and can freely be modified by clients.
          
   Location (locator)
          Represents a location in an XML entity. Initialized by being
          passed a locator, from which it reads off the current location,
          which is then stored internally.

   getColumnNumber ()
          Return the column number of the location.
          
   getLineNumber ()
          Return the line number of the location.
          
   getPublicId ()
          Return the public identifier for the location.
          
   getSystemId ()
          Return the system identifier for the location.
