<H1>xmlproc: A Python XML parser</H1>

<TR><TH ALIGN=left>Author:    <TD>Lars Marius Garshol

<H2>What is xmlproc?</H2>

<P>
xmlproc is an XML parser written in Python. It is a fairly complete validating parser, but does not
do everything required of a validating parser, or even a well-formedness parser. The average
user should not run into any omissions, though. Later releases will be more complete.
</P>

<P>
xmlproc now supports both <A HREF="xmlproc-catalog-doco.html">SGML Open Catalogs and XCatalog 0.1</A>.
</P>

<H2>Deviations from the XML specification</H2>

<P>
xmlproc does not follow the XML specification in these respects:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Parameter entities in external DTD subsets are not allowed inside declarations,
          only between them.
  <LI>No attempt is made to deal with different character sets or encodings.
  <LI>The parser does not check for the illegal characters below &amp;#x20;.
  <LI>Some internal consistency checks on the DTD (such as that the values of default
          attribute values are valid) are not performed.
  <LI>NOTATION attributes are not fully supported.
  <LI>Single-character entities are not handled correctly.
</UL>

<P>
All other deviations from the specification are unintentional bugs and should be reported
to me via email. Hopefully, xmlproc will be 100% compliant in version 1.00.
</P>

<H2>Using xmlproc</H2>

<P>
xmlproc can be used both as a command-line parser and as a parser API
you can use to write XML applications.
</P>

<H3>The command-line parser</H3>

<P>
The command-line parser is in xpcmd.py for well-formedness parsing and xvcmd.py
for validating parsing. Currently xpcmd.py only accepts one
argument: the URL to the file to parse. (You can use just the file
name instead of a full URL if you like.) 
</P>

<P>
xvcmd.py has more options:
</P>

<PRE>
Usage:

  xvcmd.py [-c catalog] [-l language] {-o format] [urltodoc]

  ---Options:  
  catalog:  path to catalog file to use to resolve public identifiers
  language: ISO 3166 language code for language to use in error messages
  format:   Format to output parsed XML. 'e': ESIS, 'x': canonical XML
            No data will be outputted if this option is not specified
  urltodoc: URL to the document to parse. (You can use plain file names
            as well.) Can be omitted if a catalog is specified and contains
            a DOCUMENT entry.  
            
  Catalog files with URLs that end in '.xml' are assumed to be XCatalogs,
  all others are assumed to be SGML Open Catalogs.

  If the -c option is not specified the environment variables XMLXCATALOG
  and XMLSOCATALOG will be used (in that order).
</PRE>

<H3>Basic usage</H3>

<P>
If you want to make a program that gets data from the parser you
should subclass the Application class in xmlapp.py. This is a sample
xmlproc client:
</P>

<PRE><CODE>
from xml.parsers.xmlproc import xmlproc

class MyApplication(xmlproc.Application):
    pass # Add some useful stuff here

p=xmlproc.XMLProcessor()  # Make this xmlval.XMLValidator if you want to validate
p.set_application(MyApplication())
p.parse_resource("foo.xml")
</CODE></PRE>

<H3>More detailed information</H3>

<P>
The xmlproc APIs are now <A HREF="xmlproc-doco.html">documented</A>. Note however,
that if possible, you should use the <A HREF="saxlib.html">SAX API</A> instead of xmlprocs native API.
This is because the SAX API will allow you to switch parsers without changing your application
code.
</P>

<H2>Licence?</H2>

<P>
xmlproc is free and you can do as you like with it. If you change it,
please let me know.
</P>

<H2>Getting xmlproc</H2>

<P>
You can download xmlproc <A HREF="xmlproc.zip">here</A>.
</P>

<H2>Changes since last release</H2>

<P>
These are the changes since version 0.51:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>40% speed increase for well-formedness parsing. The improvement for validating
          parsing seems to be around 25%. (Depends a lot on DTD size versus document size.)
  <LI>Error reporting improved. Better error messages, and support for error messages
          in different languages.
  <LI>xvcmd.py option interpretation improved (-l option added)
  <LI>Numerous minor parse bug fixes
  <LI>Some API extensions:
    <UL>
      <LI>CatalogManager.get_public_ids() method added
      <LI>DTD.get_elements() method added
      <LI>Parser.set_error_language() method added
      <LI>optional bufsize argument added to Parser.parse_resource()
    </UL>
</UL>

<H2>Feedback</H2>

<P>
Any and all feedback is welcome, from suggestions for improvements or new features
to bug reports. And I really mean it! If you have some opinions on this program, please
let me hear them.
</P>

<H2>Email notification of new versions</H2>

<P>
To be notified by email when a new version is released, fill out this
form. I guarantee that these email addresses won't be used for any
other purpose, and that you'll receive notification if the service
dies. (If you follow the Python XML-SIG mailing list you won't need to register here
since new releases will also be announced there.)
