=== Changes to xmlproc since version 0.51:

  - 40% speed increase for well-formedness parsing. The improvement
    for validating parsing seems to be around 25%. (Depends a lot on
    DTD size versus document size.)
	
  - Error reporting improved. Better error messages, and support for
    error messages in different languages.
	
  - xvcmd.py option interpretation improved (-l option added)
	
  - Numerous minor parse bug fixes
  
  - Some API extensions:
    - CatalogManager.get_public_ids() method added
    - DTD.get_elements() method added
    - Parser.set_error_language() method added
    - optional bufsize argument added to Parser.parse_resource()
