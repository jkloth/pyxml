The files in this directory demonstrate maintaining a quotation
collection in XML.  The still-unnamed markup language contains
'quotation' elements, which contain the text of the quotation and
optional 'author' and 'source' elements.  For the quotation text,
there are some simple semantic markups such as 'em', 'cite', and
'foreign'.

quotations.dtd		DTD for the markup language.
sample.xml              A sample quotation file.
qtfmt.py		Program to read a file marked up using the language
			specified in quotations.dtd, and output the 
			list in HTML, text, or fortune format.
