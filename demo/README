This directory contains demo programs that show how to use various XML
processing interfaces.  The demo programs are:

Parser demos:
=============

xpcmd.py 
    A command-line interface to the xmlproc parser in non-validating mode.
The program takes one command-line argument, a URL for the document to be
parsed.

xvcmd.py:
    A command-line interface to the xmlproc parser in validating mode.
The program takes one command-line argument, a URL for the document to
parsed.


SAX demos:
==========
saxdemo.py
	A demo SAX application that uses SAX to parse XML documents into
either ESIS or canonical XML.

saxstats.py
	A simple SAX application that counts the number of elements,
attributes and processing instructions in a document.

saxtimer.py
	A simple SAX application that measures the time spent parsing
a document with an empty document handler.

saxtrace.py
	A minimal SAX application that just prints out the
document-handler events it receives.

DOM demos:
==========

hmap:
	Accesses a Web page and parses the HTML to produce a list of
the Linux HOWTO documents.

html2html:
	Parses an HTML document into a DOM tree, and then generates
HTML output from the tree.

sgt:
	Converts an instance of the Linuxdoc DTD into HTML using the
DOM.  This is just a proof-of-convert demonstration, not a finished
program.
