What is xmlarch.py?

The xmlarch.py module contains an XML architectural forms processor written 
in Python. It allows you to process XML architectural forms using any 
parser that uses the SAX interfaces. The module allow you to process 
several architectures in one parse-pass. Architectural document events 
for an architecture can even be broadcasted to multiple DocumentHandlers. 

The XML architecture processor uses the SAX DocumentHandler interface 
which means that you can register the architecture handler (ArchDocHandler) 
with any SAX 1.0 compliant parser.

No meta-DTDs are currently read by xmlarch.py, but a DTD parser will be 
used when one is avaliable.

Note that this is a very early release and that a lot of things may be 
missing. But; it's free!

All kinds of feedback is valuable for the further development of xmlarch.py.

Enjoy!
