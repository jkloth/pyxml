Changes in this version, compared to 0.6.6:

	* Expat 1.95.2 has been integrated.

	* James Tauber has contributed an implementation of TREX,
	  in the xml.schema.trex module.

	* xmlproc has been updated to produce Unicode strings in
	  Python 2.x using the Python codecs to convert the input.

	* 4XPath and 4XSLT from the 4Suite package have been
	  integrated as xml.xpath and xml.xslt. Both packages are a
	  few releases behind 4Suite. In case of conflicts with
	  a 4Suite installation, passing --without-{xpath,xslt}
	  to setup.py is recommended.

	* XBEL has been updated to revision 1.1.

	* The C14N code in xml.dom.ext.c14n was completely rewritten.

	* Swedish and French messages have been added to xmlproc.

	* New SAX2 drivers have been added for htmllib, sgmllib,
	  sgmlop, and sgmlop_html.

The Python/XML distribution contains the basic tools required for
processing XML data using the Python programming language, assembled
into one easy-to-install package.  The distribution includes parsers
and standard interfaces such as SAX and DOM, along with various other
useful modules.  

The package currently contains:

	* XML parsers: Pyexpat (Jack Jansen), xmlproc (Lars Marius
Garshol), sgmlop (Fredrik Lundh).

	* SAX interface (Lars Marius Garshol)
	* minidom DOM implementation (Paul Prescod)
	* 4DOM and 4XPath from Fourthought (Uche Ogbuji, Mike Olson)
	* Schema implementations: TREX (James Tauber)
	* Various utility modules and functions (various people)
	* Documentation and example programs (various people)

The code is being developed bazaar-style by contributors from the
Python XML Special Interest Group, so please send comments, questions,
or bug reports to <xml-sig@python.org>.
