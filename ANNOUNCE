================== 
Version 0.6.3 of the Python/XML distribution is now available.  It
should be considered a beta release, and can be downloaded from
the following URLs:

http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.3.tar.gz
http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.3.win32-py1.5.exe
http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.3.win32-py2.0.exe
http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.3-1.5.2.i386.rpm
http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.3-2.0.i386.rpm

Changes in this version, compared to 0.6.2:

	* Include documentation in binary packages as well.

	* Update to Expat 1.2, offer all Python Unicode codecs to
          expat.

        * support the lexical-handler property in the expat SAX driver.

	* Restructure DOM interfaces to better accomodate multiple
          DOM implementations: provide standard exceptions and symbolic
          constants (including those inside of the Node interface) in
          xml.dom.

	* Improve minidom: validate arguments and raise DOM exceptions,
          correct NameNodeMap operations, offer cloneNode, splitText,
          DocumentType, DOMImplementation, and correct various other
          errors.

	* Restore xml.unicode for compatibility with PyXML 0.5. This is
          a pure-Python implementation of the iso8859 module, which can
          only convert between ISO-8859-x and UTF-8. Python 2 users
          should use the Unicode type instead of this service.

	* Fix memory leaks in expat parser and pulldom.

The Python/XML distribution contains the basic tools required for
processing XML data using the Python programming language, assembled
into one easy-to-install package.  The distribution includes parsers
and standard interfaces such as SAX and DOM, along with various other
useful modules.  

The package currently contains:

	* XML parsers: Pyexpat (Jack Jansen), xmlproc (Lars Marius
Garshol), sgmlop (Fredrik Lundh).

	* SAX interface (Lars Marius Garshol)
	* minidom DOM implementation (Paul Prescod)
	* 4DOM from Fourthought (Uche Ogbuji, Mike Olson)
	* Various utility modules and functions (various people)
	* Documentation and example programs (various people)

The code is being developed bazaar-style by contributors from the
Python XML Special Interest Group, so please send comments, questions,
or bug reports to <xml-sig@python.org>.
