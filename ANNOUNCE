The Python/XML distribution contains the basic tools required for
processing XML data using the Python programming language, assembled
into one easy-to-install package.  The distribution includes parsers
and standard interfaces such as SAX and DOM, along with various other
useful modules.  

The package currently contains:

	* XML parsers: Pyexpat (Jack Jansen), xmlproc (Lars Marius
Garshol), sgmlop (Fredrik Lundh).

	* SAX interface (Lars Marius Garshol)
	* minidom DOM implementation (Paul Prescod)
	* 4DOM from Fourthought (Uche Ogbuji, Mike Olson)
	* Schema implementations: TREX (James Tauber)
	* Various utility modules and functions (various people)
	* Documentation and example programs (various people)

The code is being developed bazaar-style by contributors from the
Python XML Special Interest Group, so please send comments, questions,
or bug reports to <xml-sig@python.org>.
