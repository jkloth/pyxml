================== 
Version 0.8.3 of the Python/XML distribution is now available.  It
should be considered a beta release, and can be downloaded from
the following URLs:

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.8.3.tar.gz
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.8.3.win32-py2.2.exe
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.8.3-2.2.Suse81.i386.rpm


Changes in this version, compared to 0.8.2:

        * Fix memory leak in Expat bindings (content model information
          provided by Expat was not freed as required).
        * New convenience classes in the xml.ns module:
          ClosedNamespace, OpenNamespace.
        * The symbol "_" is no longer inserted into the built-in
          namespace via the gettext module; I18N support is no longer
          invasive.
        * expatreader now implements feature_namespace_prefixes.
	* drv_xmlproc now supports EntityResolvers that return system IDs.
        * Various bugs have been fixed: 728810, 733890.

The Python/XML distribution contains the basic tools required for
processing XML data using the Python programming language, assembled
into one easy-to-install package.  The distribution includes parsers
and standard interfaces such as SAX and DOM, along with various other
useful modules.

The package currently contains:

        * XML parsers: Pyexpat (Jack Jansen), xmlproc (Lars Marius
          Garshol), sgmlop (Fredrik Lundh).
        * SAX interface (Lars Marius Garshol)
        * minidom DOM implementation (Paul Prescod, others)
        * 4DOM and 4XPath from Fourthought (Uche Ogbuji, Mike Olson)
        * Schema implementations: TREX (James Tauber)
        * Various utility modules and functions (various people)
        * Documentation and example programs (various people)

The code is being developed bazaar-style by contributors from the
Python XML Special Interest Group, so please send comments and
questions to <xml-sig@python.org>.  Bug reports may be filed on
SourceForge:
