================== 
Version 0.6.2 of the Python/XML distribution is now available.  It
should be considered a beta release, and can be downloaded from
the following URLs:

http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.2.tar.gz
http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.2.win32-py1.5.exe
http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.2.win32-py2.0.exe
http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.2-1.5.2.i386.rpm
http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.2-2.0.i386.rpm

Changes in this version, compared to 0.6.1:

	* Synchronize with standard library from Python 2.0

	* Updated to 4DOM from 4Suite 0.9.1. This corrects many
	errors, see the 4Suite ChangeLog for details. Most notably,
	the SAX reader interface has been expanded to support
	arbitrary parsers, and a PyExpat reader class was added.

	* Add minidom functions: normalize and hasAttribute.

	* Fix a number of minor bugs.

	* More tests pass now, in particular test_dom, and test/dom/test.

The Python/XML distribution contains the basic tools required for
processing XML data using the Python programming language, assembled
into one easy-to-install package.  The distribution includes parsers
and standard interfaces such as SAX and DOM, along with various other
useful modules.  

The package currently contains:

	* XML parsers: Pyexpat (Jack Jansen), xmlproc (Lars Marius
Garshol), xmllib.py (Sjoerd Mullender) using the sgmlop.c accelerator
module (Fredrik Lundh).

	* SAX interface (Lars Marius Garshol)
	* DOM interface (Stefane Fermigier, A.M. Kuchling)
	* 4DOM interface from Fourthought (Uche Ogbuji, Mike Olson)
	* xmlarch.py, for architectural forms processing (Geir Ove Grønmo)
	* Various utility modules and functions (various people)
	* Documentation and example programs (various people)

The code is being developed bazaar-style by contributors from the
Python XML Special Interest Group, so please send comments, questions,
or bug reports to <xml-sig@python.org>.
