================== 
Version 0.5.1 of the Python/XML distribution is now available.  It
should be considered a beta release, and can be downloaded from
the following URLs:

	http://www.python.org/sigs/xml-sig/files/xml-0.5.1.tgz
	http://www.python.org/sigs/xml-sig/files/xml051.zip

Changes in this version:

	* A sizable DOM test suite has been written.  The test suite
turned up a number of bugs which have all been fixed, which greatly
increases my confidence in PyDOM's compliance with the DOM
Recommendation.  Test suites have also been added for various other
modules.

	* Added marshalling into various XML-based formats: a generic
one for Python objects, WDDX, and XML-RPC.  The generic marshaller can
be subclassed to implement marshalling into a specific DTD; both the
WDDX and XML-RPC marshallers were implemented in this fashion.
 
	* Collected the licences for everything into a LICENCE file.

	* Various subpackages (sgmlop, xmlarch, xmlproc, expat) have
been upgraded to their most recent versions.

The Python/XML distribution contains the basic tools required for
processing XML data using the Python programming language, assembled
into one easy-to-install package.  The distribution includes parsers
and standard interfaces such as SAX and DOM, along with various other
useful modules.  

The package currently contains:

	* XML parsers: Pyexpat (Jack Jansen), xmlproc (Lars Marius
Garshol), xmllib.py (Sjoerd Mullender) using the sgmlop.c accelerator
module (Fredrik Lundh).

	* SAX interface (Lars Marius Garshol)
	* DOM interface (Stefane Fermigier, A.M. Kuchling)
	* xmlarch.py, for architectural forms processing (Geir Ove Grønmo)
	* Unicode wide-string module (Martin von Löwis)
	* Various utility modules and functions (various people)
	* Documentation and example programs (various people)

The code is being developed bazaar-style by contributors from the
Python XML Special Interest Group, so please send comments, questions,
or bug reports to <xml-sig@python.org>.

bring, they carry them as silently away.
