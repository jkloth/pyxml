Changes in this version, compared to 0.8:

  * Various bug fixes:
    - tracing works now with pyexpat
    - fix registry key for MSIE XBEL support
    - correct ill-formedness of xmlproc.dtd2schema
    - avoid adding comments and PIs in the internal subset as Document
      children when building minidom trees
    - properly close files in xml.dom.ext.reader.*

  * XSLT is not installed anymore by default, specify --with-xslt
    if desired

  * Update Expat to 1.95.5

  * Add features to xml.parsers.expat:
    - new method "UseForeignDTD"
    - new attribute "features"

  * Update to 25 July 2002 LS spec for xml.dom.xmlbuilder.  Use
    expatbuilder if no parser is given to
    xml.dom.minidom.parse[String].

  * Fix many obscure DOM bugs

  * Define and document the implementation-defined behaviors of
    cloneNode() for xml.dom.minidom.

  * Use urllib2 instead of urllib throughout.


The Python/XML distribution contains the basic tools required for
processing XML data using the Python programming language, assembled
into one easy-to-install package.  The distribution includes parsers
and standard interfaces such as SAX and DOM, along with various other
useful modules.

The package currently contains:

        * XML parsers: Pyexpat (Jack Jansen), xmlproc (Lars Marius
          Garshol), sgmlop (Fredrik Lundh).
        * SAX interface (Lars Marius Garshol)
        * minidom DOM implementation (Paul Prescod, others)
        * 4DOM and 4XPath from Fourthought (Uche Ogbuji, Mike Olson)
        * Schema implementations: TREX (James Tauber)
        * Various utility modules and functions (various people)
        * Documentation and example programs (various people)

The code is being developed bazaar-style by contributors from the
Python XML Special Interest Group, so please send comments and
questions to <xml-sig@python.org>.  Bug reports may be filed on
SourceForge:
