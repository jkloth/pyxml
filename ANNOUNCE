================== 
Version 0.6.4 of the Python/XML distribution is now available.  It
should be considered a beta release, and can be downloaded from
the following URLs:

http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.4.tar.gz
http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.4.win32-py1.5.exe
http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.4.win32-py2.0.exe
http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.4-1.5.2.i386.rpm
http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.4-2.0.i386.rpm

Changes in this version, compared to 0.6.3:

	* 4DOM was integrated from 4Suite 0.10.2. 4DOM is now
          maintained as a part of PyXML. A detailed list of changes can
          be found in xml/dom/ChangeLog.

	* minidom now supports the standard methods isSameNode and
          hasAttributes, and the extension toprettyxml. A number of
	  bugs have been fixed

	* If expat 1.95.x is available on the system, this is used instead
	  of the included expat copy; it will then offer additional handlers.

	* A pyexpat parser can now return the attributes ordered, and
	  restrict the attribute list to the specified attributes.

	* The xmllib SAX1 driver now generates Unicode strings in
          Python 2.

	* The xml.unicode emulation was extended to support bidirectional
	  conversion, and to support a few more aliases.

The Python/XML distribution contains the basic tools required for
processing XML data using the Python programming language, assembled
into one easy-to-install package.  The distribution includes parsers
and standard interfaces such as SAX and DOM, along with various other
useful modules.  

The package currently contains:

	* XML parsers: Pyexpat (Jack Jansen), xmlproc (Lars Marius
Garshol), sgmlop (Fredrik Lundh).

	* SAX interface (Lars Marius Garshol)
	* minidom DOM implementation (Paul Prescod)
	* 4DOM from Fourthought (Uche Ogbuji, Mike Olson)
	* Various utility modules and functions (various people)
	* Documentation and example programs (various people)

The code is being developed bazaar-style by contributors from the
Python XML Special Interest Group, so please send comments, questions,
or bug reports to <xml-sig@python.org>.
