Changes in this version, compared to 0.7:

	* sgmlop offers the XMLUnicodeParser (contributed by Walter Dörwald).

	* setup.py now supports the option --with(out)-pyexpat.

	* On Mac OS X, -flat_namespace is used to build extensions.

	* XBEL support for parsing Opera, MSIE, and Netscape bookmarks
	  was improved.

	* c14n is now documented in the reference manual.

	* Support for older expat versions is dropped from pyexpat.

	* pyexpat can intern strings found during parsing in a dictionary.

	* xml.ns now provides XLINK and RNG namespaces.

	* 4DOM supports now arbitrary Unicode element and attribute names.

	* pulldom supports the iterator protocol.

	* Spanish xmlproc messages have been added.

	* xml.sax.expatreader has a feature to intern strings, and a
	  property to access the interning dictionary.

	* Construction of Unicode regular expressions in
	  xml.utils.characters happens lazily through accessor functions.

	* Various bugs have been fixed (4DOM, minidom, c14n,
	  marshal.generic, xmlproc, sax.expatreader, sax.writer,
	  xml.utils.iso8601)


The Python/XML distribution contains the basic tools required for
processing XML data using the Python programming language, assembled
into one easy-to-install package.  The distribution includes parsers
and standard interfaces such as SAX and DOM, along with various other
useful modules.  

The package currently contains:

	* XML parsers: Pyexpat (Jack Jansen), xmlproc (Lars Marius
Garshol), sgmlop (Fredrik Lundh).

	* SAX interface (Lars Marius Garshol)
	* minidom DOM implementation (Paul Prescod)
	* 4DOM and 4XPath from Fourthought (Uche Ogbuji, Mike Olson)
	* Schema implementations: TREX (James Tauber)
	* Various utility modules and functions (various people)
	* Documentation and example programs (various people)

The code is being developed bazaar-style by contributors from the
Python XML Special Interest Group, so please send comments, questions,
or bug reports to <xml-sig@python.org>.
