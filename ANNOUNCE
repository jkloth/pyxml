================== 
Version 0.6.5 of the Python/XML distribution is now available.  It
should be considered a beta release, and can be downloaded from
the following URLs:

http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.5.tar.gz
http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.5.win32-py1.5.exe
http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.5.win32-py2.0.exe
http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.5-1.5.2.i386.rpm
http://download.sourceforge.net/pyxml/PyXML-0.6.5-2.0.i386.rpm

Changes in this version, compared to 0.6.4:

	* setup supports two command line options, --with-libexpat and
	  --ldflags to specify an alternative Expat installation.

	* Fourthought has contributed a new type xml.utils.boolean to
	  distinguish boolean from integral values.

	* The scripts xmlproc_parse and xmlproc_val, which allow
	  command-line interaction with xmlproc, are now included.

	* The WDDX marshalling now supports a "strict" and a "loose"
	  mode of operation.

	* minidom now supports the DocumentFragment interface, and
	  correctly sets the ownerDocument property.

	* A SAX exception now retrieves line number information when
	  it is created, not when it is printed.

	* Invoking sax2lib.ValidatingReaderFactory.make_parser creates
	  a reader object that is already set to validating mode.

	* A number of callback errors in the SAX2 xmlproc driver have
	  been corrected.

The Python/XML distribution contains the basic tools required for
processing XML data using the Python programming language, assembled
into one easy-to-install package.  The distribution includes parsers
and standard interfaces such as SAX and DOM, along with various other
useful modules.  

The package currently contains:

	* XML parsers: Pyexpat (Jack Jansen), xmlproc (Lars Marius
Garshol), sgmlop (Fredrik Lundh).

	* SAX interface (Lars Marius Garshol)
	* minidom DOM implementation (Paul Prescod)
	* 4DOM from Fourthought (Uche Ogbuji, Mike Olson)
	* Various utility modules and functions (various people)
	* Documentation and example programs (various people)

The code is being developed bazaar-style by contributors from the
Python XML Special Interest Group, so please send comments, questions,
or bug reports to <xml-sig@python.org>.
