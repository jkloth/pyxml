TODO list:
	* Make more passes over the documentation
	* More demo programs 
	* Add READMEs to existing demo programs
        * Re-indent everything to 4-space indents
	* saxlib.AttributeList should really support all dictionary behaviour
	* Flesh out the test suite
	* Should PyPointers be added?
	* Update the Windows DLLs

test/
	* Add xmlarch tests to test suite

demo/xbel/	
	* Implement dump_lynx method in bookmark.py
	* Update all the software to match the current XBEL DTD

dom/
	* Should 'Exception' be removed from exception names?
	* Problem: Take two Text nodes next to each other.  Hold a
reference to the second one.  Call .normalize() on the parent.  The
second Text node has now vanished, so calls using it will now crash.
How to fix?  (Replace w/ empty Text node?)
	* Add indentation & pretty-printing to .toxml()

	* Should check that Document node has only one Element child
before changing anything (DocumentFragments complicate this)

	* NodeList returned from .getElementsByTagName should be live

	* DocumentType class is mostly unfinished; what should the
interface for creating them look like?

	* Element.removeAttributeNode needs to know about DTDs to
restore a default value.

	* Walker: merge walk() and walk1() into one function (or at
least make it more generic)

	* XmlLineariser: what should it do with PIs and other similar things?
