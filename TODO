TODO list:
        * Namespace support for DOM(major thing)
(SAX namespace support can wait and see what the current effort to revise
SAX will produce in a few months; SAX2 may add a standard filter for
namespaces or something similar.) 
        * Integrate widestring support with the PyExpat module (major thing)
	* Make more passes over the documentation
	* More demo programs 
	* Add READMEs to existing demo programs
	* Lots of docstrings!
        * Re-indent everything to 4-space indents
	* saxlib.AttributeList should really support all dictionary behaviour
	* Flesh out the test suite more
	* Update the Windows DLLs

demo/xbel/	
	* Update all the software to match the current XBEL DTD

dom/
	* Implement reading of SGML documents for FileReader

	* DocumentType class is mostly unfinished; what should the
interface for creating them look like?

	* Element.removeAttributeNode needs to know about DTDs to
restore a default value.

	* Walker: merge walk() and walk1() into one function (or at
least make it more generic)

	* XmlLineariser: what should it do with PIs and other similar things?

	* NodeList returned from .getElementsByTagName should be live.
(Hard, and doesn't seem to be very useful; AMK doesn't really care.)
