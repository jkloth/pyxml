TODO list:

	* Make more passes over the documentation
	* Produce plain-text versions of the docs
	* More demo programs (add qtfmt.py)
	* saxlib.AttributeList should really support all dictionary behaviour
	* Flesh out the test suite
	* Should PyPointers go in this version?
	* xmllib.py : bugs (different ones) in both fast & slow versions

After 1.0 final:
	* Start working on DOM again (July 20 draft)
