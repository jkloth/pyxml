TODO list:

	* Make more passes over the documentation
	* More demo programs 
	* saxlib.AttributeList should really support all dictionary behaviour
	* Flesh out the test suite
	* Should PyPointers be added?
	* Start working on DOM again (August 18 draft)

test/
	* Add xmlarch tests to test suite
	* Add iso8601 tests to test suite

demo/xbel/	
	* Implement dump_lynx method in bookmark.py

dom/
	* Implement the .cloneNode() method
	* Problem: Take two Text nodes next to each other.  Hold a
reference to the second one.  Call .normalize() on the parent.  The
second Text node has now vanished, so calls using it will now crash.
How to fix?  (Replace w/ empty Text node?)
	* Add indentation & pretty-printing to .toxml()
	* Document methods: createTextNode but createElement?  Weird
inconsistency...
